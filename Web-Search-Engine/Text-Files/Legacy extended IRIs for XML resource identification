Abstract
For historic reasons, some formats have allowed variants of IRIs that
   are somewhat less restricted in syntax, for example XML system identifiers
and W3C XML Schema anyURIs.  This document provides a
   definition and a name (Legacy Extended IRI or LEIRI) for these variants for
   easy reference.  These variants have to be used with care; they
   require further processing before being fully interchangeable as
   IRIs.  New protocols and formats should not use Legacy Extended IRIs.

1 Introduction
For historic reasons, some formats have allowed variants of IRIs [RFC3987] that
   are somewhat less restricted in syntax, for example XML system identifiers
and W3C XML Schema anyURIs.  This document provides a
   definition and a name (Legacy Extended IRI or LEIRI) for these variants for
   easier reference.  These variants have to be used with care; they
   require further processing before being fully interchangeable as 
   IRIs.  New protocols and formats should not use Legacy
Extended IRIs.  The provisions in this
   document also apply to Legacy Extended IRI references.

2 Notation
In this document, characters are referenced by
   using a prefix of 'U+' followed by four to six hexadecimal digits.
In this document, the key words must, must not, required,
   shall, shall not, should, should not, recommended, may,
   and optional are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
3 Legacy Extended IRI Syntax
The syntax of Legacy Extended IRIs (LEIRIs) and LEIRI references is
the same as that for IRIs and IRI references except that
ucschar is redefined. The syntax of this
   ABNF is described in [RFC5234].  Character numbers are taken from the
   UCS, without implying any actual binary encoding.  Terminals in the
   ABNF are characters, not bytes.
For consistency with [RFC3987] for IRIs,
generic LEIRI software should not check
LEIRIs for conformance to this syntax.
Some productions are ambiguous.  The "first-match-wins" (a.k.a.
   "greedy") algorithm applies.  For details, see [RFC3986].

The restriction on bidirectional formatting characters in
Section 4.1 of [RFC3987]
   is lifted.  The iprivate production becomes redundant.
Formats that use Legacy Extended IRIs may further restrict the
   characters allowed therein, either implicitly by the fact that the
   format as such does not allow some characters, or explicitly.  An
   example of a character not allowed implicitly may be the NUL
   character (U+0000).  However, all the characters allowed in IRIs must
   still be allowed.
4 Conversion of Legacy Extended IRIs to IRIs
To convert a Legacy Extended IRI (reference) to an IRI (reference), each character allowed in a Legacy Extended IRI (reference)
   but not allowed in an IRI (reference) (see 5 Characters allowed in Legacy Extended IRIs but not in IRIs) must be
   percent-encoded by applying the following steps:
    
Convert the character to a sequence of one or more octets
         using UTF-8 [RFC3629].
Convert each octet to %HH, where HH is the hexadecimal notation
of the octet value.  Note that this is identical to the percent-encoding
mechanism in Section 2.1 of [RFC3986].  To reduce variability,
the hexadecimal notation should use uppercase letters.
Replace the original character with the resulting character
         sequence (that is, a sequence of %HH triplets).
Conversion from a LEIRI to an IRI or a URI must be performed only when absolutely necessary and as late as possible in a processing chain. In particular, neither the process of converting a relative LEIRI to an absolute one nor the process of passing a LEIRI to a process or software component responsible for dereferencing it should trigger percent-encoding.
5 Characters allowed in Legacy Extended IRIs but not in IRIs
This section provides a list of the groups of characters and code
   points that are allowed in Legacy Extedend IRIs but are not allowed
   in IRIs or are allowed in IRIs only in the query part.  For each
   group of characters, advice on the usage of these characters is also
   given, concentrating on the reasons not to use them.Space (U+0020)
Some formats and applications use space as a delimiter, for example, for
items in a list.  Appendix C of [RFC3986] also mentions that
white space may have to be added when displaying or printing long URIs; the
same applies to long IRIs.  This means that spaces can disappear or can make
the Legacy Extended IRI to be interpreted as two or more separate IRIs.Delimiters "&lt;" (U+003C), "&gt;" (U+003E) and '"' (U+0022)
Appendix C of [RFC3986] suggests the use of
double-quotes ("http://example.com/") and angle brackets
(&lt;http://example.com/&gt;) as delimiters for URIs in plain text.
These conventions are often used and also apply to IRIs.  Legacy Extended IRIs
using these characters will be cut off at the wrong place.Unwise characters "\" (U+005C), "^" (U+005E), "`" (U+0060), "{"
      (U+007B), "|" (U+007C) and "}" (U+007D)
These characters
      originally have been excluded from URIs because the respective
      codepoints are assigned to different graphic characters in some
      7-bit or 8-bit encoding.  Despite the move to Unicode, some of
      these characters are still occasionally displayed differently on
      some systems, for example, U+005C as a Japanese Yen symbol.  Also, the
      fact that these characters are not used in URIs or IRIs has
      encouraged their use outside URIs or IRIs in contexts that may
      include URIs or IRIs.  In case a Legacy Extended IRI with such a
      character is used in such a context, the Legacy Extended IRI will
      be interpreted piecemeal.The controls (C0 controls, DEL and C1 controls, U+0000 - U+001F U+007F - U+009F)
There is no way to transmit these characters reliably
      except potentially in electronic form.  Even when in electronic
      form, some software components might silently filter out some of
      these characters or may stop processing alltogether when
      encountering some of them.  These characters may affect text
      display in subtle, unnoticable ways or in drastic, global and
      irreversible ways depending on the hardware and software involved.
      The use of some of these characters may allow malicious users to
      manipulate the display of a Legacy Extended IRI and its context.Bidi formatting characters (U+200E, U+200F, U+202A-202E)
These
      characters affect the display ordering of characters.  Displayed
      Legacy Extended IRIs containing these characters cannot be
      converted back to electronic form (logical order) unambiguously.
      These characters may allow malicious users to manipulate the
      display of a Legacy Extended IRI and its context.Specials (U+FFF0-FFFD)
These code points provide functionality
       beyond that useful in a Legacy Extended IRI, for example byte
       order identification, annotation and replacements for unknown
       characters and objects.  Their use and interpretation in a Legacy
       Extended IRI serves no purpose and may lead to confusing display
       variations.Private use code points (U+E000-F8FF, U+F0000-FFFFD, U+100000-
      10FFFD)
Display and interpretation of these code points is by
      definition undefined without private agreement.  Therefore, these
      code points are not suited for use on the Internet.  They are not
      interoperable and may have unpredictable effects.Tags (U+E0000-E0FFF)
 These characters provide a way to include language
       tags in Unicode plain text.  They are not appropriate for Legacy
       Extended IRIs because language information in identifiers cannot
       reliably be input, transmitted (for example, on a visual medium such as
       paper), or recognized.Non-characters (U+FDD0-FDEF, U+1FFFE-1FFFF, U+2FFFE-2FFFF,
      U+3FFFE-3FFFF, U+4FFFE-4FFFF, U+5FFFE-5FFFF, U+6FFFE-6FFFF,
      U+7FFFE-7FFFF, U+8FFFE-8FFFF, U+9FFFE-9FFFF, U+AFFFE-AFFFF,
      U+BFFFE-BFFFF, U+CFFFE-CFFFF, U+DFFFE-DFFFF, U+EFFFE-EFFFF,
      U+FFFFE-FFFFF, U+10FFFE-10FFFF)
These code points are defined as
      non-characters.  Applications may use some of them internally, but
      are not prepared to interchange them.
For reference, we here also list the code points and code units not
   even allowed in Legacy Extended IRIs:Surrogate code units (U+D800-U+DFFF)
These do not represent Unicode
      codepoints.
