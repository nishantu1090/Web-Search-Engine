The Web Search Engine application works as a search engine. User can enter a word to search on the web and he is pointed to the web URLs which contains the searched word.

Change the Directory Path at these locations:

1> Web-Search-Engine/Web-Search-Engine/src/webEngine/TrieInitializer.java at line 15
2> Web-Search-Engine/Web-Search-Engine/src/webEngine/HTMLParser.java at line 12

Please give the path of the directory where you want to have the HTML Parser write the text files.
